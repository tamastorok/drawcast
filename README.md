# Welcome to Drawcast!

Drawcast is a mini app where users draw prompts and challenge their friends, bringing the spirit of web2 social games into the onchain world. Drawcast addresses the need for more engaging, social, and fun experiences within the onchain ecosystem. It offers playful interactions that can onboard new users.


What makes Drawcast unique is that it aims to blend familiar user experience with onchain innovation and utility:
- Users can coin their drawings, turning sketches into collectibles or monetizable content.
- Premium features like extra colors and profile badges are unlocked through fully onchain payments via Daimo Pay.

This lowers the barrier for new users to interact with onchain tools in a natural, fun way, without needing to understand complex underlying mechanisms.
